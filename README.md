# OpenCL Video Processing Project

This project demonstrates the use of OpenCL to perform image processing on video frames in real-time. The project includes a C++ implementation with OpenCV for video capture and display, and OpenCL for parallel processing of the video frames using Sobel filters for edge detection.

## Features
- Real-time video processing using OpenCL.
- Edge detection using Sobel filters applied to video frames.
- GPU acceleration for image processing tasks.
- Integration with OpenCV for video capture and display.

## Requirements
- **OpenCL SDK**: Ensure that your system has OpenCL installed (drivers and SDK) for your GPU.
- **OpenCV**: This project uses OpenCV for video capture and display. Install OpenCV 3.x or later.
- **Visual Studio**: This project is built using Visual Studio. You can open the `.sln` file and build the project.

### Libraries
- OpenCL
- OpenCV (required for video capture and display)

### Platforms Supported
- **Windows** (Tested on Visual Studio)
- **GPU Required**: The code is designed to run on systems with a compatible GPU for OpenCL.
